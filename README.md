## Installation

Unless previously installed you'll need the following packages:

- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
- [Redis](http://redis.io/)

Please use their sites to get detailed installation instructions.

#####Possible Errors

Make sure you have Node.js installed. Some package managers name the binary nodejs. You can symlink it to make it work.
`sudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node`

You also need `UglifyJS` installed globally:

    $ npm install uglify-js -g

### Install binb

Once you have redis server up and running type:

    $ make install

Then run `$ npm start` or `$ node app.js` to start the app.

Point your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:8138` and have fun!
